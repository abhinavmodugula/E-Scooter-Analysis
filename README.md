# E-Scooter-Analysis

This analysis is a part of the 2021 UMD Data Challenge Competition.

Two months of campus VeoRide E-Scooter Data was analyed. The actual data files have been omitted due to the fact that they exceed GitHub's maximum file size requirments.

The two notebooks, Oct 2019 and Oct 2020, are where the analysis was conducted. In order to run them, you will first have to add a Google Maps API Key.
